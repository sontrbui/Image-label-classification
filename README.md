# Image-label-classification
In this notebook, I will try the process of implementing Convolutional Neural network with Tensorflow and Keras in order to classify images from the image data of Natural Scenes around the world. This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 }
